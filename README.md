# Algorithms Projects with Python
Algorithms are the foundations of computer science. In this series of liveProjects, you’ll learn how to use specific algorithms to solve some important programming problems. You’ll learn how to use recursion to draw complex shapes, search linked data structures, and layout and draw trees. You’ll learn how to use network algorithms to find shortest paths and assign employees to jobs. Tackle all the projects in this series, and you’ll get useful hands-on experience with a variety of algorithmic topics, data structures, and general programming techniques.
